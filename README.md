# 4-to-4-Bit-Greater-than-Comparator
Algorithm was designed with Karnaugh Maps and ESOP groupings, then translated to a quantum circuit. This circuit is programmed in language Qiskit. Two 4-bit (binary) numbers are inputs to the circuit, and the output is a YES/NO function of if the first binary number is larger than the second. Originally this was designed to be implemented in the Cost Counter Comparator of the ternary-input, binary-output Kronecker Reed-Muller Forms Quantum Oracle, but due to the limitations of Qiskiit larger variable oracles were ommited from the final paper and thus this circuit was ommited as well.
